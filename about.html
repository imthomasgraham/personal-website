              Hello, I'm Thomas Graham. Thank you, for visiting my website. I
              have been interested in programming since I was in middle school.
              My passsion for Software Development actually came from a game
              called Roblox. Roblox has a studio that uses a programming
              langauge Lua to produce games. From there I went on to learn a
              little of C++ and some blender as well. Eventually, I found out
              what a Software Engineer actually was and I enrolled in to FSA. It
              has been a bit of a challenge so far and I look forward to where
              it takes me.
